# Multi Posture Leg Tracker

This C++ repository contains multiple algorithms to track people in multiple postures (walking/standing, crouching/squatting) using multimodal sensing (radar and/or LoDAR). The package contains diverse algorithms combined in the tracking pipeline:
- leg detectors
- leg trackers
- track fusion
- and more

Dependencies:
- ROS
- CGAL
- mlpack
- openCV
- Boost
- Eigen
